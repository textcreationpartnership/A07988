            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orſomuch (right highe and mightie Prince) as both this our diuine Prophet S. <hi>IOHN,</hi> intreating here moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie of the deſtruction of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſeate, citie and kingdome, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the execution of that great worke of Gods Iuſtice and iuſt iudgement to the Kings of the earth: as alſo the whole Prophets of al ages, haue for the moſt part, directed al their admonitions generally to Kings, princes and gouernors, to the effect that they (as Heads-men) being by holy admonitions forewarned, might (according thereto) holde all the whole body of their commoun wealth in good order: for certaine it is, that the heade being well affected, will of neceſsitie miniſtrat health and wholſome humors to the whole body. Therefore, it is likewiſe the dutie of Gods ſeruants in this age, interpreters of Prophecies, as well (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of the Prophets) to incourage and inanimate Princes, to be ready againſt that greate day of the Lords reuenge, as alſo to exhort them generally, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all ſuch impediments in their cuntries and common wealths, as may hinder that work, &amp; procure Gods plagues. For the which cauſes, wee alſo all your M. Subiects, that
<pb facs="tcp:13406:3"/>
any waies (how litle ſoeuer) haue addicted our ſtudies vnto theſe propheticall myſteries, doth not onely craue your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to abide conſtant and couragious againſt that day of the deſtruction of that Apoſtatik ſeate and citie, in caſe (God willing) it fall in your time: but alſo in the meane time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the reformation of that Idolatrous ſeate, to be preparing and purging your M. own ſeat and kingdome, from all the enemies of that cauſe: yea, and from all others any waies enemies or abuſers of Iuſtice: for verely and in trueth, ſuch is the iniury of this our preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, againſt both the Church of God, and your M. true Lieges, that Religion is deſpiſed, and Iuſtice vtterly neglected: for what by Atheiſts, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Cold profeſſors, the religion of God is mocked in al eſtates: Againe, for partialitie, prolixitie, dearth, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of lawes, the poore periſhe, the proud triumphe, and Iuſtice is nowhere to be found. Praying your M. to attend your ſelf vnto theſe enormities, and (without caſting ouer the credite thereof to wrong wreſters of Iuſtice) your M. ſelf, to wit certainly, that iuſtice be done to theſe your true &amp; godly Lieges, againſt the enemies of Gods Church, and their moſt cruell oppreſſors: Aſſuring your M. be concordance of al ſcriptures, that if your M. miniſtrate Iuſtice to them, God the ſupreme Iudge ſhal miniſtrate Iuſtice to you againſt al your enemies: and contrarily, if otherwiſe. Therefore, Sir, let it be your M. continuall ſtudy (as called and charged thereunto by God) to reforme the vniuerſall enormities of your country, and firſt (taking example of the princely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid) to begin at your M. owne houſe, familie and court, and purge the ſame of all ſuſpicion of Papiſts, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts or Newtrals, wherof this Reuelation foretelleth, that the number ſhall greatly increaſe in theſe latter daies. For ſhall any Prince be able to be one of the deſtroiers of that
<pb facs="tcp:13406:3"/>
great ſeate, and a purger of the world from Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, who purgeth not his owne countrie? ſhal he purge his whole country, who purgeth not his owne houſe? or ſhal hee purge his houſe, who is not purged himſelfe by priuate medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations with his God? I ſay therefore, as God hath merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begunne the firſt degree of that great worke in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward minde, by purging the ſame from all apparant ſpot of Antichriſtianiſme, as that fruitfull meditation vpon the 7.8.9. and 10. verſes of the 20. Chapter of the Reuelation, which your highnes hath both godly &amp; learnedly ſet forth, doth beare plaine teſtimony, to your M. high praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: So alſo wee beſeeche your M. (hauing conſideration of the treaſonable practiſes in theſe preſent daies, attempted both againſt Gods trueth, your authoritie, and the common wealth of this countrie,) to proceede to the other degrees of that reformation, euen orderly from your M. owne perſone till your highnes familie, and from your family to your court. Til at laſt, your M. whol country ſtand reformed in the feare of God, ready waiting for that great day, in the which it ſhall pleaſe God to call your M. or yours after you, among other reformed Princes, to that greate and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall reformation, and deſtruction of that Antichriſtian ſeat and citie Rome, according to the wordes prophecied, Apoc. 17. ſaying: The ten horns are ten Kings &amp;c. Theſe are they that ſhall hate that harlot, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eate vp her fleſh and burne her ſelfe with fire: Beſide alſo a warrant and commaund generally giuen to all men. Apoc. 18. ſaying, Rewarde her euen as ſhee hath rewarded you, and giue her double according to her workes, and in the cup that ſhe hath filled to you, fill her the double. And now, becauſe the ſpirit of God, both by all his Prophets generally, and by S. Iohn particularly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb facs="tcp:13406:4"/>
and directs the execution of Iuſtice to kings and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, I truſt no man ſhall thinke, that this our diſcouery (wherein is contained Gods Iuſtice and ſeuere iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Antichriſtian ſeate) can more iuſtly be dedicate vnto any man, than vnto theſe ten Chriſtian Kings, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times maintainers of that ſeat, whome, or whoſe ſucceſſors now both the Prophet promiſes to be executers of that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo in whoſe kingdomes reformation is already begunne: But becauſe of theſe kingdomes, ſometimes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of that ſeate, and nowe deſiſting therefro, this your M. Realme is vndoubtedly one, as alſo this preſent treatiſe both being written by your highnes ſubiect, and in your M. natiue language, were vnproper to be directed to any of the other Princes. Therefore, of neceſsitie I am led (as by the eare) to direct &amp; dedicate theſe primices &amp; firſt fruites of my ſtudy vnto your highnes, wherein, if perchance I ſhould ſeme any waies more preſumpteous then acceptable, I doubt not, but your M. clemencie will pardone that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that comes of neceſsitie: But contrarily, if I herein ſhall be found acceptable, (as verely I look for, of your M. humanitie) then certainly, not onely conioyne I vnto the former neceſsitie, a voluntary heart, and ſo do offer theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, both gladly &amp; neceſſarily vnto your highnes, but alſo it ſhall incourage both me and others your M. Lieges, to proceede every man in his own calling, to all kinde of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly workes, and good exerciſes, to the honour of God, aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church, your highnes renowne, and welfare to your M. realme, when they ſhall finde your clemencie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Patrone and protector of all zealous ſtudents, and an allower and accepter of their godly exerciſes: For let not your M. doubt, but that there are within your Realme (als wel as in other countries) godly and good ingynes, verſed &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13406:4"/>
exerciſed in al maner of honeſt ſcience, and godly diſcipline, who by your M. inſtigation might yeelde foorth workes and fruites woorthie of memory, which otherwiſe (lacking ſome mightie Maecenas to incourage them) may perchance be buried with aeternall ſilence. Hoping therefore, that your highnes will be a protector of vs and our godly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: wee pray and humblie beſeech the Almightie, to be alſo vnto your highnes ſelfe and moſt honourable bedfellowe, the Queenes M. a perpetuall protector of your honourable eſtates and welfare of your perſones, both in body and ſoule, to the quieting of your M. lieges, increaſe of the true church, and honour of God, to whome, in Trinitie and Vnitie bee praiſe for euer.

<pb facs="tcp:13406:5"/>
Almightie) to expounde and open vp the myſteries of this Revelation by a two-folde diſcourſe, the one Paraphraſtical, the other hiſtoricall, both confronted together: I haue thought good before that work, to premit by way of introduction, a reſoning for the inueſtigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true ſenſe and meaning of euery notable myſterie thereof, and to ſette the ſame in forme of Propoſitions, as neere the analytick or demonſtratiue maner, as the phraſe and nature of holy ſcriptures will permit: and that for the better ſatisfaction of theſe Naturaliſts, of whome happely, God may either make true ſpirituall profeſſors, or at the leaſt, hereby bridle their opprobrious mouthes from calumniating the vndoubted trueth, when they ſee the naturall coherence of Gods myſteries ſo maruelouſly reuealing one another, that thereby the trueth of God, the hiſtory of his Church, and perſon of the Antichriſt are detected, and the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians induced neceſſarilie, either to confeſſe themſelues to bee hereby diſcouered, or then muſt they deny the ſcripture it ſelfe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue but of late attempted, to write this ſo high a worke, for preuenting the apparant danger of Papiſtrie ariſing within this Iland, yet in trueth, it is no fewe yeares ſince firſt I beganne to precogitat the ſame: For in my tender yeares, and barneage in Sanct-Androis at the Schooles, hauing on the one parte contracted a louing familiaritie with a certaine Gentleman, &amp;c. a Papiſt: And on the other part, being attentiue to the Sermons of that worthie man of God, <hi>Maiſter Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Goodman,</hi> teaching vpon the Apocalyps, I was ſo mooued in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, againſt the blindnes of Papiſts, that could not moſt euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee their ſeuen hilled citie Rome, painted out there ſo liuely by Saint Iohn, as the mother of all ſpirituall whoredome, that not onely bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted I out in continual reaſoning againſt my ſaid familiar, but alſo from thenceforth, I determined with my ſelfe (by the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) to employ my ſtudie and diligence to ſearch out the remanent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of that holy book: as to this houre (praiſed be the Lorde) I haue bin doing at al ſuch times, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniently I might haue occaſion: But (to confeſſe the trueth of the infirmitie of man to the glory of God) I found euer during al that long time, more fruit in one houres ſobrietie, prayer, and humble meditation, nor in a thouſand daies of curious or preſumptuous inquiſition: yea, the more ſubtily I ſearched, the more darknes I found, in ſo much, as curious inquiſition rather diſcouraged me by finding out of doubts, then profiteth me by finding any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: And ſo, when after long time ſpent, with litle knowledge, I (juſtly diſpairing of mine owne habilitie) became trulie ſorrowfull and humble in heart, then it pleaſeth God, (to whome be the onely glory) to giue me that grace, to eſpy in ſhort time, that woonderfull ouerture which in long time before I could not conſidder: So that then I began to take vp matters by their right beginning, and by moſt eaſie grounds, And to proſecute out the reſt by their coherence in order, as is here ſet downe, to the full reſolution of all the former doubts. After the which, although (greatly rejoycing in the Lord) I began to write thereof in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:
<pb facs="tcp:13406:6"/>
yet, I purpoſed not to haue ſet out the ſame ſuddenly, and far leſſe to haue written the ſame alſo in Engliſh, til that of late, this new inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Papiſts ariſing about the 1588. year of God, and dayly incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing within this <hi>Iland</hi> doth ſo pitie our hearts, ſeeing them put more truſt in Ieſuites and ſeminarie Prieſts, then in the true ſcripturs of God, and in the Pope and King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> then in the King of Kings: that, to preuent the ſame, I was conſtrained of compaſſion, leauing the Latine, to haſte out in Engliſh this preſent worke, almoſt vnripe, that hereby, the ſimple of this <hi>Iland</hi> may be inſtructed, the godly confirmed, and the proud and fooliſh expectations of the wicked beaten downe, purpoſing hereafter (God willing) to publiſh ſhortly, the other latin editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof, to the publike vtilitie of the whol church. Whatſoeuer therfore through haſt, is here rudely and in baſe language ſet downe, I doubt not to be pardoned thereof by all good men, who conſidering the neceſſitie of this time, wil eſteeme it more meete, to make haſt to preuent the riſing againe of Antichriſtian darknes within this Iland, then to prolong the time in painting of language: Eſpecially alſo, ſeeing herein purpoſely I preſſe not to follow the particular ornate tearmes, of neither Scottes nor Engliſhmen: but rather contrarily for both their inſtructions, I vſe ſo much as I can theſe wordes and tearmes, that be more common and ſenſible to them both, then proper or ornate to any one of them. Here then (beloued Reader) thou haſt this work deuided into two trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, the firſt is the ſaid introduction and reaſoning, for inveſtigation of the true ſenſe of euery cheife Theological tearme and date contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Reuelation, whereby, not onely is it opened, explained and interpreted, but alſo that ſame explanation and interpretation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, confirmed and demonſtrated, by euident proofe and coherence of ſcriptures, agreeable with the euent of hiſtories. The ſeconde is, the principal treatiſe, in the which the whole Apocalyps, Chapter by chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Verſe by verſe, and ſentence by ſentence, is both Paraphraſtically expounded and Hiſtorically applyed. This ſecond and principall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, keepeth this order, that firſt before euery chapter, is premitted the argument, not of the literall ſenſe of the chapter, but of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and interpretation of the ſame. Thereafter (ſeeing all the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Apocalyps, doth either deſcribe the viſion, or then expreſſe the prophecie) if the preſent chapter be deſcriptiue, euery page thereof is diuided in two columnes: in the firſt whereof, is ſet the text by verſes, in the ſecond columne, is ſet the Paraphraſticall expoſition, anſwering verſe by verſe to the text of the firſt columne: But if the preſent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be prophetical, then is euery page thereof diuided in three colums, the firſt containeth the Text by verſes, the ſecond the Paraphraſticall expoſition thereof verſe by verſe, the third alſo agreeable therewith by verſes, containeth the hiſtory or hiſtoricall application, in the which, and by the which, the ſame prophecie is, or ſhall be performed. And if any chapter is partly deſcriptiue, partly propheticall, then where it is propheticall, there are three columnes, the firſt is the Text, the ſecond,
<pb facs="tcp:13406:6"/>
is the Paraphraſticall expoſition of the text: The third, is the hiſtoricall application &amp; accompliſhment thereof. But where in that ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any part is deſcriptiue, then are there forenent that part onely two columnes, whereof the firſt is the Text, the ſecond is common to both the Paraphraſtical columne, &amp; to the hiſtorical columne: and therfore it paſſeth through, occupying the roome of both the ſecond and third columnes, ſo that when yee read the ſecond columne, ye ſhall read it with the ſecond columne, and when againe ye read the third columne, yee ſhall alſo reade it with the third columne: for it is ſuch a common thing, as agrees to be read with either of them. Furthermore, there is two drawne lines betwixt the Paraphraſtical columne and the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, within the which lines there is ſet downe the dates of times, by ſeals trumpets, viols, thunders, and years of God, anſwering to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time, in the which every Prophecie thereof was or ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Moreouer, in caſe any part of the text may be thoght to be wrong tranſlated, any part of the Paraphraſe wrong expounded: or finally, any part of the hiſtory wrong applied, ouer briefly handled, not ſufficiently prooued, or hauing neede of annotations: I haue therefore forenent euery doubtfull and needful place of the Text, Paraphraſe, and Hiſtory, ſet markes of the ordinary letters of <hi>a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. In the Paraphraſe, and after the end of the whole chapter hath ſubjoyned Notes, Reaſons, and Amplifications, marked correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly with the like letters of <hi>a b c,</hi> &amp;c. by the which Notes and Amplifications, not onely the breuitie of the Paraphraſe and hiſtory is ſupplied, but alſo by reaſons, proofes, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſcripture therein inſert, the whol ſmaller doubts thereof are reſolued. And as toward the greter doubts, they are referred to the firſt treatiſe, wherein they are at length and demonſtratiuely prooued. So the note here in the ſecond treatiſe, doeth onely quote the propoſition of the firſt treatiſe, that proues that preſent aſſertion. And becauſe this whole work of Reuelation concerneth moſt the diſcouerie of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and Papiſticall kingdome, I haue therefore (for remouing of all ſuſpition) in al hiſtories and prophane matters, taken my authorities and cited my places either out of Ethnick auctors, or then papiſtical writers, whoſe teſtimonies by no reaſon can bee refuſed againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But in matters of diuinitie, doctrine &amp; interpretation of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (leauing all opinions of men) I take me onely to the interpretation and diſcouerie thereof, by coherence of ſcripture, and godly reaſons following thereupon: which alſo not only no Papiſt, but euen no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may juſtly refuſe. And foraſmuch as our ſcripturs herein are of two ſortes, the one our ordinary text, the other extraordinary citations, In our ordinary text, I follow not altogether the vulgar Engliſh tranſlation, but the beſt learned in the Greek tong, ſo that (for ſatisfying the Papiſts) I differ nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vulgar text of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> as they cal it, except in ſuch places, where I proue by good reaſons, that hee differeth from the Originall Greek. In the extraordinary texts of other ſcriptures cited by
<pb facs="tcp:13406:7"/>
me, I followe euer <hi>Ieromes</hi> latine tranſlation, where any controuerſie ſtands betwixt vs and the Papiſts, and that moueth me in diuers places to inſert his very latine text, for their cauſe, with the juſt Engliſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for ſupply of the vnlearned. And hereof it commeth that our quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are according to the ſections and verſes of <hi>Ieromes</hi> tranſlation, printed in Antwerpe by <hi>Plantine,</hi> agreeing alſo with the great concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances of <hi>Robert Stephane.</hi> In other textes not controuerted, the Engliſh text, it alone is ſufficient in a Scottiſh or Engliſh tretiſe, &amp; therfore omit we the latin. Further as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning my citations of ancient &amp; vnſuſpect writers, I haue choſen the ſame out of the moſt old &amp; faithfull copies, cheiflie thoſe that be found in old Popiſh libraries, and imprinted by Popiſh Printers: But as for the new coppies and latter editions, there is a malicious ordinance obſerued in theſe latter daies, by the which, the Friers of <hi>Louane,</hi> and other Papiſticall correctors, eiketh, paireth, &amp; peruerteth al good and rare bookes, cauſing firſt one ſort of them to be imprinted vnder their teſtimoniall, ſo that (as that ſame teſtimoniall therein imprinted beareth) nothing is left therein that may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Romane Church, although the Authour by his true edition had neuer ſo much inveighed againſt Rome. Therafter al the remanent Popiſh Printers, do follow theſe new peruerted Coppies, in their latter editions, without any teſtimoniall, as being warranted by the ſaide firſt teſtimonial: &amp; this is moſt euident to be ſeen by their book intituled <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Expurgatorius.</hi> Praying therfore al good men to beware of theſe, We deſire earneſtly with our hearts ſto to proceede hereinto, that trueth may come to light, and that ſuch groundes may be laid, as thereby the ignorant and ſimple Reader may be beſt inſtructed, the godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtian moſt ſurely confirmed, and the arrogant and obſtinate caluminator rathereſt confounded &amp; put to ſilence. But forſomuch as this our good intention and godly purpoſe, doeth alwaies proceede of a very tender and frail veſhell, and that as all liquors (how precious ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) doth take ſome taſt of their veſhells: So this holy worke may in ſome thinges (though not eſpied by my ſelfe) taſt of my imperfections. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humblie I ſubmit theſe imperfections whatſoeuer, to the gentil cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of every wiſe and diſcreete perſon, who in the motion of Gods ſpirite judgeth vprightly, without envie or partialitie. Praying all good men to haue me apardoned of whatſoeuer is a miſſe: for although I haue not done herein perfectly as I would, yet zealouſlie as I could, knowing that the poore Widdowes mite was acceptable vnto the Lord: for euery man hath not gold, ſiluer, ſilks &amp; purple to offer to the work of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: to me (as ſaith <hi>Ierome</hi>) it ſhall be much, If I may purchaſe wooll, or flockes to offer to that holy work. And ſurely, this that I haue, howe ſmall ſoeuer it be, till God enlarge me with more I offer it gladly, vnto the glory of God and aedification of his true Church. To God therfore the diſpoſer of this, and all other godly workes and meditations, who liueth and raigneth eternally in Trinitie and Vnitie; be glory praiſe, laude and thanks, for euer and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Thirdlie, they were in number foure (ſaith the text) ſo were there of theſe <hi>Mahometanes</hi> foure chiefe nations; to wit, <hi>Turks, Tartarians, Saracens,</hi> and <hi>Arabians:</hi> and foure imperiall or royall families; to witte, <hi>Aſſimbeis, Candelors, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes</hi> and <hi>Ottomannes.</hi> Fourthlie, they were hitherto bound (ſaieth the text) about the riuer <hi>Euphrates:</hi> and ſo haue they their reſidence about <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where they were ſo bound &amp; tied by ciuill &amp; inteſtine warres, that they came not by weſt Euphrates to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, till after this yeare of Chriſt 1296. which time the whole Mahometicke Empire ouer the moſt part of the ſaid four nations, came from the other three fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13406:11"/>
in the onlie hande of <hi>Ottomannus</hi> their firſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Fiftlie, theſe were appointed (ſaith the Text) at this time to ſlay the third part of men. And ſo did they, what by corporall, and what by ſpirituall death, ſlay, conqueſt, and poyſon with hereſie, all <hi>Aſia</hi> and much of <hi>Europe,</hi> euen the large third part of the world. Which propertie can bee attributed to none other hitherto, but to the ſaide Mahometike Armie, which exceeded far, anie Armie hard of in Chriſtian hiſtories. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſixtlie, ar they numbred to ſo great a multitude in the text, to wit, two hundred thouſand thouſands horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Seuenthlie, as out of the mouthes of the Deuill, the Antichriſtian beaſt, &amp; this fals <hi>Mahomet,</hi> proceeded out three vncleane ſpirits, ſtirring vp the world to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as the Text ſpecifies: So, by the hiſtorie it is found, that out of their mouthes proceeded ſuch inſpirations of the Deuill, and deuiliſh exhortations, that ſtirred vp (in fierie wrath, in ſmoking hereſie, and in ſulphurious and bitter auarice) the whole worlde to battell: that is to ſay, theſe Mahometanes, Emperors of the whole <hi>Orient,</hi> againſt the Antichriſtian beaſt, ſupreame head of the <hi>Occident,</hi>

               <p>SEing at the powring out of the fift vial, or ſounding of the fift trumpet, the Turkes began their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnder <hi>Zadok,</hi> in Anno Chriſti 1051. by the thirde propoſition: &amp; by the fourth propoſition, at the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſixt Trumpet, &amp; powring out of the ſixt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the whole foure nations Mahometanes began their great Empire in <hi>anno Chriſti</hi> 1296. Therefore, the fift Trumpet or Viall indured from the 1051. yeare, to the 1296. yeare, which is the ſpace of 245. yeares. Nowe, that euerie one of the reſt of the Trumpets or Vialles doeth containe the ſame ſpace, it is probable by theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe in euerie diſtribution, aequalitie is moſt apparant and probable, and ſo theſe ſeuen ages, termed by trumpets and vialles, appeare to haue no reaſon, why one ſhould bee longer and another ſhorter, but rather all alike. Secondlie, as in thoſe 245. yeares the effectes of the fift Trumpet and Viall were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (as now is prooued) ſo by our paraphraſticall and hiſtoricall Diſcourſe you ſhall finde, that in the former 245. years, the effect of the fourth Trumpet and Vial, and in the 245. yeares before theſe, the effect of the third Trumpet or Viall was perfourmed: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the effects of euery one of the reſt of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets or vials were perfourmed in their owne ſpace of 245. yeares, ingendering ſo in theſe intervals of 245. yeares a perfect harmonie &amp; analogie betwixt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie and hiſtorie. Thirdly, becauſe every one of theſe ages are tearmed and diſtinguiſhed by the ſounds of trumpets here, as the <hi>Iubelees</hi> were in<note place="margin">Leuit. 25, 9</note> 
                  <hi>Leviticus.</hi> For there, at the end of every 49. year, and beginning of the 50. yeare the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets ſounded, making betwixt everie ſounding thereof 49. yeares preciſely for a Iubelee interuall without any oddes, as the name <hi>Iubileus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13406:12"/>
which ſignifieth a Tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet or Cornet: Therfore, muſt thoſe ages alſo contain certain whole Iubelee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terualls,<note place="margin">Hier. de int. nominum.</note> preciſelie without any ods: otherwiſe, appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, they woulde not haue bene limited here by the ſoundes of Trumpets, as the Iubelees are. Then, if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of theſe ages doeth containe foure Iubelees, which is 196. yeares, or ſixe Iubelees, which is 294 yeares, the one ſhall be ſo few, and the other ſhal bee ſo manie, that the hiſtorie could not agree thereto: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, fiue Iubelees, which is 245. yeares (as the middeſt betwixt extremities) agreeth exquiſitlie. Fourthlie, it is found in hiſtories, that great mutations of Empires followed 245. years one after another: as, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was deſtroied An. 71. An. 316. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall ſeat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> Pope <hi>Sylueſter</hi> began the Papiſticall kingdome. Anno 561. or thereabout, <hi>Totila</hi> king of Goths burned <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the dominion thereof. Anno 806. <hi>Charlemaign</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the newe Empire of Germanes and Romanes. Anno 1051. <hi>Zadok</hi> began the firſt dominion of the Turkes. Anno 1296. <hi>Ottoman</hi> began the firſt Empire of the foure nations Mahometanes. Laſt of all, about the year 1541. aroſe our true profeſſors againſt the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt. And euerie one of theſe great mutations followed 245. yeares one after another. And this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <hi>Carion,</hi> and other Hiſtoriographers, to affirme by diuers obſeruations, that fiue<note place="margin">Carion. lib. 4. de Henr. 4. Imp.</note> hundred yeares (as groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie they thinke, or rather exactlie, 490. yeares) is <hi>fatalis periodus imperioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the fatal period of Empires,</hi> for that it is about twiſe 245. yeares. Fiftlie, 245. yeares, is the juſt halfe of the greate Iubelee, or ſeuentie weekes of <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> containing 490. yeares: And becauſe the worlde would not ſtand whollie ſeuen of theſe great Iubelees; therefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> by the Spirite of God deuideth ſeuen halfs of the great Iubelee, among the ſeuen Trumpets, or vials. Sixtlie, ther are books of the Iewes, containing (as they alledge) doctrines proceding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouthes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13406:12"/>
of the Patriarches, affirming euery great Angel of ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to rule the world 490. yeares: which wee (wanting the warrant of Scripture) can neither affirm nor condemn. Alwaies (if it be ſo,) the halfe thereof, to wit, 245. years is taken in ſteade of the whole, becauſe (as is ſaide) the time to come to the worlds end, woulde not containe ſeuen whole, and to containe fewer diuiſions than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that had bene repugnant to the propheticall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that deuides all by ſeuen: as ſeuen ſeales, ſeuen tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, ſeuen vials, ſeuen thunders, &amp;c. So then, for conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion, euerie trumpet or viall endureth 245. yeares.</p>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from this yeare of Chriſt 365. wee are commaunded to reckon 1335. years, which falles in An. 1700. And then (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> verſ. 6) ſhall be the end of all wonders, euen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and great day of the Lord: But yet, as this Prophecie doth abridge the foreſaid prophecie of <hi>Elias,</hi> ſo alſo Chriſts foreſaid ſaying in <hi>Matthew,</hi> that came after this Prophecie,<note place="margin">Mat, 24, 22,</note> doth appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly abridge ſomwhat of this time: for the which, now we proceed to the laſt Prophecie in the <hi>Reuelat.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie therfore, it is reaſoned in the former propoſition, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thundering Angell of three, contained 49. yeares, and then comes the great day of the Lord: and by the 12. Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the firſt thundring Angel, began in An. 1541. to which ad thriſe 49. yeares, which is 147. yeares: and ſo by that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the latter day will fall in An.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, appearinglie betwixt this 1688. yeare, according to the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> and the 1700 yeare, according to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the ſaid latter day ſhould fall. And for further confirmation hereof, there is a number put in the end of the 14. chap. of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> which appears to be a date of the latter day: for that chapter altogether ſpeaketh of the Lordes great harueſt, and latter judgement. There (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) The blood came out of the Wine-preſſe vnto the Horſe bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſixe hundred ſtades or courſes: as if appearinglie, he would meane metaphoricallie, as wine may be thought to flowe from the preſſe, or the blood of ſlaine men in a fielde, to aſcend to the horſe bridles: ſo, aeternallie ſhall the torment of the wicked aſcend, after that a thouſand and ſixe hundred yeares be accompliſhed: For, theſe <hi>Stades</hi> agree well to meane yeares, ſeeing a <hi>ſtade</hi> is that race or courſe, that one may be thought to run with one breath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begin to renewe his breath againe: as one yeare is that race or courſe, that the Sunne maketh in a circuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begin to renewe his circuit againe. Nowe, counting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13406:19"/>
therefore, a thouſande and ſixe hundreth yeares, from the time that this was written, which was about the 97. yeare of Chriſt, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicle ſaith, or in the end of the raign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, which was in Anno Chriſti 99. The end of the count ſhall fall about the yeare of Chriſt 1697. or the yeare 1699. which is betwixt the ſaide terme 1688. and 1700. And ſo the difference of theſe dates is but ſmall, and if the time of hiſtories wer ſurely written and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, it may be thought, that the difference would bee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe, or vtterlie nothing at all.</p>

&amp; their teſtimonie neither buried in our breſts, nor ingraued in our harts, during al the daies of the Antichriſt. And ſo the time of their lying dead, and the time of the Antichriſtes raigne to be all one date. Now, the time that they lay dead, is called three daies and an halfe, and the time that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt raigned, and oppreſſed Gods Church, is called 42 mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: wherefore, three great daies and an halfe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 11.2 Apoc. 13.5</note> are all one with 42. moneths, or 1260. daies: It reſteth then, to prooue a time, times, and half a time, to be likewiſe aequall to them, which muſt needes be for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is ſaid, (Cap. 12.6.) that the <hi>Woman</hi> (which hereafter is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſignifie the Church of Chriſt) fled into the wildernes, where ſhe was nouriſhed 1260. daies: And againe (verſe. 14) it is ſaide, that ſhee fled away in the <hi>wilderneſſe, where ſhee was nouriſhed for a time, times, and halfe a time.</hi> So then, <hi>a time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> and 1260. daies muſt bee both one. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, this <hi>time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> or three times and an halfe, correſpondent with the foreſaid three greate daies and an halfe, are aequall to 1260. daies for this cauſe. A time taken ſimplie and without figure, meaneth a yeare, as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Nebucadnetzars</hi> ſeuen times that he remained a beaſte,<note place="margin">Dan, 4.13 20.29</note> are taken for ſeuen yeares: Then three times and an halfe, are three yeares and an half, which being counted, wil make 42. moneths or 1260 daies: And ſo finallie, for concluſion, ſeeing the raigne of the Antichriſt, his blaſpheming of God, and oppreſsion of Gods Sainctes, the treading of ſpirituall <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> vnder feet, the prophecying of Gods witneſſe vnto the true and viſible Church in humble maner, and their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deade and ſilent, vnto the outwarde, viſible preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Church. And the flying of the Spouſe and Church of Chriſt to the wilderneſſe, and becomming inuiſible, by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concurrent and adjunct, ſuch as apparantlie muſt at one time begin together, continue together, and end together.

               <p>SEing theſe dates are prooued by the former propoſition, to be aequall, therefore neceſſarilie what one is, al is, then we com to theſe 1260 daies, which we ſay, muſt needs be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtood ſo manie natural dayes, or els ſo manie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall daies, which are prooued to bee yeares in the firſt propoſition: But natural or common dayes they can not be, for theſe cauſes. Firſt, when the prophetes in number, or great dates mean of natural dayes, they vſe to adjoin the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition thereof, by morning and euening, defined in <hi>Gene.</hi> chap. 1. as <hi>Daniel</hi> doeth chap. 8. verſ. 14. and 26. But that is not done here, this being a prophecie: and therfore, theſe ar not naturall and common daies, but conſequentlie, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall daies. Secondlie, it is not apparent, that ſo manie Prophets would haue written ſo much: for onlie a raigne of 1260 of common daies, which is but three yeare and a halfe, ſeeing manie cruell tyrantes and hereticall Emperours, that did raigne longer ouer Gods Church, were not prophecied of in particular, as <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> and others. Thirdlie, if theſe were naturall and common daies, then ſhoulde the Antichriſt raigne, but 1260. common daies, which is three yeare and an halfe: but contrarilie, it is certaine, by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> cap. 20.4.5. that the Antichriſtian beaſt had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and did raign at the leaſt a thouſand yeares, martyring the ſainctes of God, and perſecuting them that reuerenced not him and his <hi>marke,</hi> &amp;c. but ſpirituallie raigned, and liued as true Chriſtians theſe thouſand yeares, and that the reſt of the people ſhould lie dead and drunken in his errours, vntill the end of theſe thouſand years: and ſhould not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while then, begin to riſe in the firſte reſurrection, which is, to riſe from their errors. So then conſequently, theſe daies (which exceed 1000. yeares) cannot be 1260. of common daies, but 1260. propheticall daies, which are prooued by the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be 1260. yeares: &amp; ſo apparantlie, the Antichriſt raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

mightily 1000. years: the re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nant, 260. years ar attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the falling &amp; decreaſing of his kingdom, making ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his whole raign 1260 yeares, to the which, ſeeing by the former propoſition, three great daies and an halfe, or three times and an halfe is aequall, it muſt needes bee, that euery great day, or euery time, muſt not ſimplie ſignifie a common year, as <hi>Nebucadnetzars</hi> times did, but muſt ſignifie a prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tical time, or yeare,<note place="margin">Dan, 4.13 20.29</note> prooued by the firſt propoſition to be a year of years, or 360. years preciſely. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is to be vnderſtood, that the firſt makers of times, to wit the <hi>Chaldaeans, Graecians</hi> and Aſtrologes in their directions do agree with this deſcription of time: for they devide the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> into 360. degrees, and attribute a yeare for euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their directions, wherby the whole time of the great revolution or direction of the whole <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> wil bee 360 years: &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, three of theſe great times &amp; a halfe, or three times &amp; a halfe, revoluing of the whole <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> will containe 1260. yeares. And ſo <hi>Daniel,</hi> writing in the Chaldee tongue to the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo writing in the greek tongue to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> obſerved their manner of counting times, as being a vulgar compt to them. But now, although it is prooved, theſe dates to be 1260. yeares: yet, foraſmuch as 1260. of Graecian yeares, are but 1242. <hi>Iulian</hi> yeares, and 8. moneths, or there about: and 1260. <hi>Iulian</hi> years, are 1277. &amp; an half of Graecian years, making therby, neer 18. years of difference. It reſts therefore, to prooue what kind of yeares theſe be. Theſe (we ſay) ar common <hi>Iulian</hi> years, for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Firſt, although the Graecian common year contained but 12. moneths, &amp; 30. daies in every moneth, yet do they adjoin certain intercalar daies, which doth mak every year overhed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain 12. moneths, fiue daies &amp; a quarter, which is 365. daies &amp; a quarter; &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently, ar ouerhead equal with our common <hi>Iulian</hi> year. Secondly, among the Hebrue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, where a day is taken for a year, althogh the common year contain but 12. moneths, yet almoſt euery third yeare, they adjoined an intercalar moneth, by dobling the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> which made their Hebrew years ouerhead aequall alſo with our <hi>Iulian</hi> years, as teſtifieth <hi>Ioſ.

For firſt, when the word of God paſſed out on the white horſe in the firſt ſeale, betwixt the yeare of Chriſt 29. and 36. then (ſaith the text) one of the four beaſts ſaid, <hi>come and ſee, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Matthew</hi> the Apoſtle, who came that time, and wrote his firſt Euangel in hebrew, exhibiting the ſame to be ſeen of the <hi>Iewes</hi> expreſly, for conuerting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Gods word of his new couenant might victoriouſlie go out among them, to conquer &amp; ouercome (as ſaith the text) Then, in the ſecond ſeale, when S. <hi>Steuen</hi> and S. <hi>Iames</hi> were martyred, and greate perſecution roſe againſt the Church of God, <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt the 36. and 43. year of Chriſt, then (ſaith the text) the ſecond Beaſt ſaith, <hi>Come and ſee:</hi> that is, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Euangel was at that time ſet forth by <hi>Mark,</hi> to be ſeen &amp; read, in comfort of the afflicted Church. Afterward, in the third ſeale, when hunger and dearth aroſe, betwixt the 43. and 50. year of Chriſt, the third Beaſt ſaith, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> and this is <hi>Luke,</hi> whoſe Euangell came to light at that time, and was ſet forth to be ſeen, and alſo writeth of the ſame dearth, in his booke of the Acts of the Apoſtles.

Seuenthly, theſe foure Beaſts wings, eies, and all their other tokens and circumſtances, contained both in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, and here in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> doeth ſo properlie agree with the foure Euangeliſts, that they cannot be ſo conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie attributed to anie other, as ſhal be ſhewed at length in the principall Treatiſe. Eightlie, it appeareth by <hi>Hierome</hi> and others learned, that theſe indices and tokens, ſo aptlie
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13406:23"/>
agreeing to theſe foure Euangeliſts, and to their <hi>faces,</hi> haue confirmed the ancient Fathers of the Church, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue theſe foure Euangelles true and certaine, as alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell manie falſe Euangelles, written in the name of <hi>Thomas, Matthias, Bartholomaeus,</hi> and other Apoſtles.

As in confirmation hereof, it is ſaide,<note place="margin">Apo, 15.5.8</note> That the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimonie was open in heauen, and the ſeuen Angelles of the laſt plagues come out of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13406:24"/>
Temple, and afterwardes no man was able to enter into the Temple againe till theſe ſeuen plagues were fulfilled: which agreeth preciſelie with the euent after all the former ſenſes, to wit, that the true Chriſtian Churches, profeſſors of Chriſt his true teſtimonie, wer viſible and patent, their true doctrin and Chriſtian religion opened vp, and the majeſtie of God thereby made known, and manifeſted in the daies of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and afterwards, vpon neglecting their teſtimonie, &amp; vpon the contempt of the manifeſtation and opening vp thereof, there proceeded all the whole plagues of the ſeuen laſt ages, during the which, the fume of Gods wrath was ſo great, that by the Antichriſt he made his true Church lurke and become inviſible, and his truth and true religion, and knowledge of the divinitie to be obſcured and darkened: ſo that none might viſiblie enter or haue acceſſe to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, til by the ſeuenth and laſt plague, that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome began to fall, and then after 1260. yeares darkneſſe, was that true Temple of God opened and made manifeſt, as is plainlie ſaide in the<note place="margin">Apoc. 11.19</note> ſeuenth Trumpet or age.

of the new <hi>Latine</hi> Empire, which was to the Pope, authoriſing him, as their ſupreame heade, with whome they concurred, fighting againſt Chriſt, as hereafter ſhall be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But at length ſhal theſe ten Chriſtian Kinges, deſtroy that ſpiritual harlot and idolatrous Empire, as (praiſed be God) <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> with ſome others haue alreadie begun. Ninthlie, that beaſt is the <hi>Latine</hi> Empire, and the chiefe ſeate thereof is <hi>Rome:</hi> becauſe in the text, both the plain name of the <hi>Latine</hi> Empire is figuratiuely expreſsed, and the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue name of <hi>Rome</hi> is plainlie expreſſed.

Finallie, all the reſt of the ſmaller circumſtances of this ten-horned beaſt, contained in the text, doe ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and fitlie agree with the <hi>Latine</hi> Empire (as in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall treatiſe ſhall be found at length) that we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie conclude, that ſelfe ſame Beaſt to meane and ſignifie the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>Reſteth then the ſecond part of this Propoſition, to proue the Antichriſts Kingdome to be a part of the greate <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Empire.

That one parte of this beaſt, to wit, the litle blaſphemous horne thereof in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the blaſphemous mouth therof in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> doeth ſignifie the Antichriſt: it is certaine by the tokens ſet downe in the text, wherein it is ſaid, that that <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi>

Secondlie, his raigne muſt bee of that <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, for that he muſt ſit in ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> which by the former propoſition, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſo <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould become the den of all diueliſhneſſe and Antichriſtian errours, as in the principall Treatiſe vpon the 17. and 19. cap. ſhal be ſhewed.</p>

And yet, for the more ſuperabundant certaintie of this matter, we wil alſo remoue certain doubts of Scripture, which might moue the ſimple ſort (by adhearing to the literal ſence,) to beleeue that al the Antichriſts that were to come, were alredy come, and paſt in the daies of the Apoſtles; or that might any waies ſeeme to purge the Pope from being the Antichriſt.</p>

And euen then, ſaith he, there were many Antichriſts, not that he ſaith that the great Antichriſt was any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he meaneth, that there were ſo many ſmall Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks &amp; Antichriſts riſen vp, that thereby the comming of the great Antichriſt was porte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: for <hi>Paul</hi> maks this placeplain, where he ſpeaks in expres words,<note place="margin">2, The, 2</note> that the myſtery of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts iniquity was euen then begun to work, but himſelfe ſhuld not come, while he who held ſhuld yet hold ſtil a while, &amp; then be devided or remoued out of the way: meaning that the myſtery of his iniquitie, &amp; ſpirit of his errours, was then begun to work in theſe ſmall Antichriſts, forerunners of the greate Antichriſt, vnto whoſe errours (ſaith<note place="margin">2.

As to the ſecond text, it is not ſpoken of the perſon of the greate Antichriſt, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the text is meant, of the ſpirite of his errours, or (as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it) <hi>the myſterie of his iniquitie,</hi> which euen then was in the worlde and wroght in his forerunners, whome Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth alſo Antichriſts: So be theſe texts, rightly concei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved, it is gathered, that many ſmall Antichriſtes, (in whome wroght the ſpirite and myſterie of the great Antichriſt) were come in the daies of the Apoſtles, but yet not the greate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt himſelfe. Moreover, in cace it be doubted howe the Pope can be this Antichriſt, ſeeing ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that the Antichriſt denieth the Father and the Sonne,<note place="margin">1, Iohn. 2 22</note> whereas appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly the Pope denies neither of them. To this it is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there be two denialls, the one in mouth and profesſion plainely, and that way the Pope ſeemeth a Chriſtian, and not to deny Chriſt, otherwiſe he would not be credited of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, neither could hee be a meete Mediatour betwixt the Dragon and them, as the Antichriſt muſt be. The other deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is in heart and deed tacitely, and that way the Pope hath denied altogether, both the Father and the Sonn: for who ſo denieth the Son, the ſame (ſaith the ſame text immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) denies alſo the Father,<note place="margin">1, Iohn 2.23</note> and conſequently them both: But ſo it is, that the Pope denies Chriſt, in that he eſtabliſheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediators of his canonized Saints, betwixt God and vs, and vindicates to himſelf power to remit ſinnes, and ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie maketh Chriſt but a cipher, without either office of mediation, or of remiſsion of ſinnes. Wherfore, in effect the Pope denies the Son, and conſequently, both the Father &amp; the Son. And beſides this former reaſon, is not this, certain, that the 22. <hi>Necromantik</hi> Popes already ſpoken of, could not be <hi>Necroma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cers,</hi> vnles they had by priuat &amp; tacit paction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced both the Father and the Son, and became ſlaues to the Deuil for ever?

Secondly, by applying of the ſpeciall tokens of the Antichriſt preciſely to the Pope.

So then, ſeeing theſe fiue tokens do agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it followeth neceſſarily, that that abuſed character is one of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian marks. It remaineth then to proue the like concerning their croſſes of al kinds. And firſt, the croſſe is juſtly called the mark of the firſt greate <hi>Romane</hi> beaſt &amp; <hi>Latin</hi> Emperours, for three cauſes, the one becauſe that the Emperour and all his ſubjects generally, ar ſome times marked therewith, &amp; bears the ſame, as ſhall be ſaid. The other cauſe, becauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> illuded by a croſſe ſhadowe in the clouds, taketh vp at the deuiſ &amp; perſwaſion of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the firſt, and firſt Antichriſtian Pope, the marke of the croſſe, and that the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13406:37"/>
rather, becauſe (as theſe fabulous hiſtories report) his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Helena</hi> was ſaid to haue found Chriſts croſſe, &amp; ſo juſtly may the croſſe be called the mark of the firſt Beaſte and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Emperour. The laſt cauſe, why the croſſe is called the mark of the <hi>Romane</hi> Beaſt, or <hi>Latin</hi> Emperour is, for that it is taken out of his name, even out of the three numerall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof, as preſently you ſhall heare. So then the firſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Antichriſtian mark, agrees with the croſſe. Then agreeable to the ſecond token: forſomuch as by the 27. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is that Beaſts name, at the leaſt vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the numeral letters of his name are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of the which are gathered croſſes of al kinds (as immediatly ſhal be ſaid.) Therefore theſe croſſes, are juſtly called the markes of this Beaſts name. Then thirdly, according to the third token, in the ſaid numerall letters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ar contained croſſes of diuers kindes, both in figure and in name: In ſuch manner, as both the <hi>Greeke</hi> Churches and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, are certified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for among the <hi>Grecians</hi> the forme of χ is a croſſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Latins</hi> ξ which is X, is alſo a croſſe, and theſe bee croſſes aſidewaies called S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> croſſe: Therefore the third and laſt letter is a double letter of abbreuiation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining theſe two letters ς. τ. wherof the laſt is called a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les croſſe, likeſt to the croſſe, which they cal our <hi>Lords</hi> croſſe: And ſo alwaies and of euery letter hereof ariſeth the figure of the croſſe. As to the names of the croſſe, in latine <hi>crux,</hi> &amp; in greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is not poſsible for them to be expreſſed vnder ſo fewe letters more viuely, nor they are here, for here haue you their cheif letters, even both their capital &amp; their final: for by χ and ξ, haue you in Latine C. &amp; X. making <hi>crux,</hi> or. C H. and X making barbarouſlie CHRVX, as I haue ſeene &amp; heard it ſo in print &amp; pronounced. And againe by the laſt letter <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> haue yee the greeke name of the croſſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> likewiſe expreſſed, by his capitall and final letters. So then according vnto the thirde token in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ar the greek nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber or numeral letters of the beaſts name, are contained croſſes of diuers kindes, both by figure and by name evidently expreſſed, to both the orientall or greeke Churches, and to the occidentall or latine Churches, &amp; what
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13406:38"/>
is more evident? Fourthly, and agreeing to the fourth token, theſe croſſes (I meane the abuſes thereof) were deuiſed by the ſecond <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the Pope and his Clergie, as magical marks of ſorcerie, gree by gree, to withdraw that godly meditation that we ought to haue of Chriſts paſsion, and that reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that wee ought to haue towardes Chriſt, for ſuffering death for our ſakes, and to beſtowe the whole merite, honour and vertue thereof, firſt, to the material croſſe, whereon he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and then to bare figures and marks therof, and laſt of al, to other curious ſophiſtical figures and marks, ſuch as <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

which they cal the croſſe of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſuch as this croſſe <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               <p>FOr proofe hereof, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by hiſtories, that after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual and ſucceſsiue tyrannie of Ethnick Emperours, and laſt of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> (who in one moneth made ſeuenteene thouſand Martyrs) there aroſe about this 300. year of Chriſt, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the greate, a Chriſtian and baptized Emperour, who, and whoſe ſucceſſors (except a few of ſhort raign) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Chriſtianiſme and true religion, to the aboliſhing of <hi>Sathans</hi> publique kingdome: and therefore, ſay wee, this yeare <hi>Sathan</hi> is bound. Secondlie, ſhortlie after this time, was the firſt publike and generall godlie counſell, holden by the Chriſtians at <hi>Nice,</hi> in the which the Apoſtolicall beleefe was publiſhed, the authentik Scriptures authorized: and finallie, the true Chriſtian religion ſo receiued, that all <hi>Sathans</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde oppoſition was baniſhed, and his publique tyrannie and kingdome ouercome: although yet, by his Lieutenaunt the Antichriſte, euen then began his diſsimulate and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall kingdome. Thirdlie, ſeeing by the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are the armies of the ſixt trumpet and Viall: and theſe (by the fourth propoſition) were looſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of God 1296. to make warres.

Fourthlie, and for confirmation of the former, the<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.7.</note> text ſaith, that howe ſoone the Deuill is looſed, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth foorth to ſtirre vp and ſeduce, theſe <hi>Papiſtical</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke</hi> armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to ſtrife and warre-fare.

               <p>SOme by this bondage of <hi>Sathan,</hi> haue ſought out to find the viſible Church of God a thouſande yeares pure and vncorrupt, or beleeued that the true Church ſhoulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy 1000 years peace: But the plain contrary appeareth here by the fourth &amp; fift verſes, where it is meant expreſly, that in the time of theſe 1000. yeares, ſhould the Antichriſtian beaſt raign, and ſhuld ſlay and behead thoſe, that worſhipped not him, nor reverenced his mark &amp; image, but liued &amp; raigned with Chriſt Ieſus, as true Chriſtians, all theſe 1000. yeares: and that all the reſte of the people lay deade in his errours; &amp; roſe not therefrom, til theſe thouſand years were expired. And ſo, ſeeing both by this text, theſe Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ethnicks raigned in this time, as alſo by the chap. 11.2. they poſſeſſed the outward viſible Church: Therfore, could neither the true inviſible church injoy peace vnder the Antichriſt, neither yet could that viſible Church be pure &amp; incorrupt, during theſe thouſand years, but rather after the ſaid 1000. years, becauſe it is meant (verſ. 5,) that the reſt, who were dead in Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13406:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
errours ſhoulde not reuiue, or riſe there-from, till after theſe thouſand years. And beſide this, it is not ſaid, that the Deuil is bound from troubling the Church of God (which euer he troubleth) but from ſeducing or deceiuing the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles or Nations; which for the moſt parte, are taken in the Scriptures in an euill part, for the idolatrous, wicked, &amp; leud people of the worlde, to whome God here granteth theſe thouſand yeares peace; becauſe they (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 11.2) do poſſeſſe the outward and viſible Church, and haue the true inviſible Church lurking vnder their feete, which by their continuall trouble might alſo bee troubled. Then reſteth the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue parte of this propoſition, to wit, this bondage of <hi>Sathan</hi> to bee from ſtirring vp of theſe Nations, to anie vniuerſall warre-fare, while the end of theſe thouſand years. For proofe whereof, when he was looſed, then (ſaith the text) he paſſed foorth to ſtir vp the whole nations, of the foure quarters of the land of <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog,</hi> to war-fare &amp; vniverſal bloodſhed: whereas contrarilie, by hiſtories it is found, that all the 1000 yeares praeceeding, there were no ſuch huge imperial armies nor terrible bloodſhed as nowe, when the whole Papiſtes &amp; pretended Chriſtians on the one ſide, againſt the whole <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanes</hi> on the other ſide, euen the whole <hi>Occident</hi> againſt the whole <hi>Orient,</hi> vnder the names of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> were conuened in number as the ſand of the ſea, as the text ſaith. So that in compariſon hereof, all ſmall ciuill warres, skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings and incurſions, that occurred during thoſe thouſand yeares, were thought nothing but peace; and conſequentlie, thoſe terrible and vniverſall warres, that fell out from this time forth, were the onlie troubles and ſeditions, from enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and raiſing whereof, the text meaneth, that <hi>Sathan</hi> was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; reſtrained al the former 1000 years, &amp; not from ſtir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring vp of errors, hereſies, martyrdom, &amp; provincial warfare.</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">a</hi> As God hitherto neuer left his Church deſtitute of doctrine, to inſtruct them, and of prophecies to forewarne them: So here hath his Majeſtie prouided, al the former bookes hitherto of the new Teſtament, to containe the Chriſtian doctrine: and this book of <hi>Reuelation,</hi> to containe the whole Chriſtian Prophecie to the worlds end. <hi>Apocalyps</hi> then is a Reuelation, and therefore, is this book ſo intituled; for, that by the will &amp; ordinance of God, Chriſt hath reueiled the ſame, word by word, as it is written in the text, to his Diſciple <hi>Iohn,</hi> and now doth daylie by his holy Spirit, reueile more and more the meaning thereof, to vs in this our age, for the which it hath bene chieflie inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Here is this booke deſcribed to proceed from God, and come to the ſeuen Churches by foure degrees: Firſte, God giueth the ſame to Chriſt: Secondlie, Chriſt ſendeth his Angell, or Angelles bearing commiſsion: Thirdlie, the Angel inſtructeth <hi>Iohn:</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>Iohn</hi> wrireth the ſame to the ſeuen Churches. Not meaning hereby, that the Angelles onelie are appearers to <hi>Iohn:</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Father, as chap. 4. ſometime the Sonne, as in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſometime the holie Spirit, as chap. 14. 15. and other places: at which times, for confirmation of the ſmaller viſions; the Trinitie in theſe great viſions, ſheweth his vnſpeakable glorie, but in other ſmaller viſions, concerning thinges to come, the Angels (as ſayeth this text) are made reporters, ſhewers, and expoſiters, as chap. 17. 1. 7. and diuers other partes, as plainlie appeareth chap. 22. 8. 16. For, he ſaieth not here, the Angels are ſent to ſhewe all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or viſions of Gods glorie, for it was the Trinitie it ſelfe that ſhewed it ſelfe, and appeared in his owne viſions, and not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as hereafter [note <hi rend="sup">l</hi>] ſhall be ſhewed: But he ſpeaks here, of propheticall viſions, which Chriſt ſaieth here, hee ſent his Angels to ſhewe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Some haue vnaduiſedly impugned the authoritie of this book, by diuers friuolous conjectures: and among the reſt, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> hath ſo often herein named his name, thinking it not agreeable to the Apoſtolique grauitie, to caſte vp ſo oft his owne name: and therefore, eſteeme they rather this booke to bee ſette out in his name by others than by himſelfe, for that hee doeth not the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13406:47"/>
like in his Euangell. But contrary to their opinion, in all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the writers of doctrin, do not ſo often expreſſe their names, as the writers of prophecie doe: for the doctrine receiues the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the owne preſent veritie, and of the Spirite of God, but the Prophecy receiues the authority by the author, who is known to be a Prophet, wheras otherwiſe, the booke could not be known to be true before the perfourming thereof. Conſider hereupon, <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie, where ye ſhall finde his name more than three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore times repeated: yea, in the firſt perſon, ye ſhal find [<hi>I Daniel</hi>] repeated about nine times, in the 7.8.9. and 10. chapters: wheras <hi>Iohn</hi> repeateth his name but fiue times in all this booke. Hereby then no man can gather, but that this booke was written by that ſelfe ſame <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was both Chriſtes beloued Diſciple, and an Euangeliſt. And therefore, ſtileth hee himſelfe here the ſeruant of Chriſt, who hath borne witneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, of theſe thinges which he ſaw, as being one of the foure Euangeliſts that wrote the hiſtorie of Chriſt, which with his eies he ſawe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> There is but one holie Spirite, whoſe chiefe functions &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are deuided into ſeuen: wherof read the note[<hi rend="sup">e</hi>] of the fourth chapter. For the better comfort therefore of the ſeuen Churches, to ſupplie their beleefe and weake faith, hee letteth them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there is ſuch a compleat perfection in Gods Spirit, that it hath as manie functions and graces to conſerue them with, as are agreeable to their number of ſeuen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">e</hi> For two cauſes is Chriſt called the firſt born of all that died: Firſt, becauſe in the Leuitical Law, the firſt borne, and firſt fruites, or primices, were conſecrated and offered vp vnto the Lorde, and becauſe of al men that euer took life and died, onlie Chriſt is that firſt fruite, that is offred vp an acceptable Sacrifice to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Paule</hi> teſtifieth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. Therfore, he is called the firſt borne, euen in his humanitie figuratiuelie, although reallie manie others were borne neere foure thouſand yeares before him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, in conſideration of his Deitie, euen of that worde, that is God, and long after took fleſh: euen in conſideration (I ſay) of the aeternitie thereof, becauſe it was before all beginning: Therfore, is Chriſt (who is that word) called the firſt borne among the dead, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15.17.18. Althogh not the worde or Deitie that took fleſh, but the fleſh it ſelf died: and ſo in this ſenſe, the being firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13406:47"/>
is imputed to Chriſts Deitie, and aeternall word; and to die, is imputed to his fleſhlie humanitie; and ſo to Chriſt, as hee is fullie both God and man, both theſe properties of being the firſt born, and of dying, are juſtlie appropriate, according to the diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects aforeſaid.</p>

I ſay then, that ſo long as Chriſt was in this world, appearing corporallie to man, he ſtiled himſelf the Son of man, as hauing his fleſh &amp; humane body conuerſant with vs: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, both before his incarnation, as alſo ſince his aſcenſion, when euer in all the Scriptures he did viſibly appear to his Saints, his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſhape &amp; appearance, is not called the Son of man, but the lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Son of man, <hi>quaſi Filius hominis,</hi> or <hi>ſimilis filio hominis,</hi> as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.14. and in this place, or whereſoeuer els: and yet by the whole properties of theſe ſelf ſame textes, that ſame that appeared in viſion, is knowne to be Chriſt, as this ſame, who here is called the likenes of the Son of man, or like vnto the Son of man, is hereafter in expreſſe terms, called the Son of God: neither maketh this anie repugnance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, to the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial nature of Chriſt, who is really both the Son of God, &amp; the Son of man, being ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, either before his incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſince his aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion: for firſt, becaus his humanity could not be really ſeen of <hi>Daniel,</hi> before it was conceiued of the Virgin; therefore, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw Chriſts Godhead, euen that Word that is God, ſaw he tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured (for his capacity) into the likenes of a man, or likenes of the Son of man, but not in a man, nor in the Son of man, till he tooke fleſh of the Virgin. The like tranſfiguration is oft read to be alſo of Angels in the likeneſſe of men, but not in men. Alſo, ſecondlie,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13406:49"/>
ſince Chriſt his aſcenſion into heauen, his humanitie hauing reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only ther, his Deitie being both there, &amp; alſo euery where: that Deitie (I ſay) euen after Chriſts aſcenſion, as before his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is ſaid here to appeare, not in his humanitie, as the Son of man, but in the likenes of the Son of man, for that his humanitie, whereby he is the Sonne of man, is not here, but in heauen, and his Godhead which is here, taketh not the fleſh of the Sonne of man, but the viſible likeneſſe of the fleſh of man, by ſuch a notable difference, either in the viſion, or in the Spirit of the Prophet, that he knew it to be Chriſt in his Deitie, and not in his humanitie, but bearing the figure and likenes of his humanitie. Some vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie will thinke this, to meane a ſeparation of Chriſtes Deitie from his humanitie: But contrarilie, we ſay, that Chriſt his Deitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct in heauen with his humanitie, doth both make his chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence with the ſame, and doeth alſo flowe therefrom ouer all the whole world infinitlie; as in compariſon, the light beams and ſpirituall vertues of the Sun, are conjunct in heauen with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and viſible bodie of the Sun, wherein they haue their chiefe reſidence, &amp; doe alſo flow from thence vnto euerie place: Alſo, the ſpiritual vertue &amp; ſight is in the body of the eie, as his chiefe ſeat, and doth likewiſe flow from thence toward all things viſible: Can any man ſay, that the beame ſubſiſteth it ſelf alone, and is ſeparate from the Sun, or that the ſight ſubſiſts it ſelfe alone, and is ſeparat from the eie, ſeeing the bodie of the Sunne is the verie locall ſeat of light, &amp; the eie of the ſight? No more mak we Chriſts Deity alone to be ſeparate from his humanitie: the more that the Deitie is vniuerſall and euerie where, and the humanitie locallie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; for, the Deity (being euery where) is alſo in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, though it likewiſe from thence extendeth it ſelfe, &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer euery place. So that, for concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Diuinitie of Chriſt, that here appeared to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> brought not down his humanity fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, for then hee had called that humanity that appeared, the Son of man, as (cap. 2.18) he calleth his Diuinitie the Son of God: but that Diuinitie took onlie, in preſence of the Prophete, and for his inſtruction, a ſhape like a man, which therefore, he calleth not the Son of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the likenes of the Son of man.

And whereas I haue ſaide, that our Paraphraſticall expoſition, is not onely grounded vpon the preſent text, but compoſed of the conference of many texts and ſcripturs interpreting others: that haue I purpoſely &amp; by al means poſſible preſſed to do, expreſlie, becaus many interpreting the preſent text onely by it ſelfe, and according to that ſenſe that to them ſeemed moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in that place, they haue greatly erred, for to others another ſenſe doth ſeeme more proper, and ſo infinite and repugnant interpretations do ariſe: for as in the diſciphering of cyphered letters, hee who judged ſuch a marke or Character to ſignifie ſuch a letter, for that it ſo agrees and ſpells in ſome one place, he may be deceiued, and therefore he muſt take that Character for ſuch a letter as it ſpells and agrees with, not onely in that one place, but in all places where it is founde throughout that whole Epiſtle. Euen ſo in Prophecies, who by an onely texte judged ſuch a propheticall tearme or phraſe to haue ſuch a ſenſe, for that it ſo appears there to agree, he may be deceiued: and therefore he muſt take that propheticall tearme in ſuch a ſenſe, as not onely doth agree with that one preſent text, but with diuers other texts where the ſame tearme is to be found, and ſo ſhall all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters agree, and no man varie from other: for ſcriptures interpreting ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, furniſheth one onely veritie, and though ſometimes diuerſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet not diſagreeing nor repugnant, but in a manner all one: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner of interpretation do I proceede, ſo farre as God hath giuen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
